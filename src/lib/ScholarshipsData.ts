			"Merit is inherent and cannot be suppressed or dominated for long by various circumstances which are in one way or the other parts of our life. To support a merit to bloom at a proper time, resources required may not be available readily. For a meritorious aspiring student, money at times poses as an obstacle in his or her path to pursue studies. At such juncture, a scholarship helps the scholar to a great extent.\nMany a student of high merit comes from a family with weak financial capacity and in the process of studying civil engineering at Jalpaiguri Govt. Engineering College (JGEC), dearth of funds restricts them to meet the basic expenses. ",

			"Indu Bhushan Bhattacharya was born in 1923 to an economically poor family and struggled hard to pursue his studies. For want of money to pay his school fees, his name was struck off the roll a couple of months before the matriculation examination. One of his neighbours stood to the occasion to pay off the dues and Indu Bhushan passed the examination in first division. Later, in pursuing graduation, he faced the same constraints and joined a job to become the sole bread earner of the family instead of attending the college. Still, his zeal for further persuasion of studies made him to enrol in a night college in Calcutta and he stood second in B Com from the Calcutta University. His dream of further studies however ended here due to family commitments. He continued with the service in the Income Tax Department and rose to the level of IRS Officer with his dead honesty and hard work throughout his entire career. He also taught Income Tax Officers for about two years before his superannuation in 1982.\nUllas Bhattacharya is the youngest son of Indu Bhushan and pursued Civil Engineering from JGEC from 1985 to 1989 and topped the class in 1989. National Scholarship helped him a lot to meet the expenses as his father’s pension was not at all a handsome figure as nowadays. Ullas has followed the footstep of his father in social works, activities, helping the meritorious students in need and move ahead with his head high by virtue of dead honesty & sincerity. It is ",
